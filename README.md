## Features & Complete Action Capabilities

### 🧠 The 5 Pillars of Sentient AI
- **Conversational Realism**: Barge-in (<50ms local VAD) for instant interruption, natural Conversational Fillers, and native Hinglish fluency.
- **Ambient & Proactive Intelligence**: Foreground Window Context awareness, background Battery & Posture Alerts, and an intelligent Clipboard Sentry.
- **Kinetic & Visual Realism**: 3D Cursor Gaze tracking, deep Audio Reactivity, physics-based Spring Edge Snapping, and spatial Acoustic Cues built into the FloatingLauncher.
- **Live Thinking Out Loud**: Real-time action breadcrumbs and vocalized thoughts during complex multi-step execution.
- **Deep Adaptive Living Knowledge Graph**: Zero-latency heuristic auto-learning that silently extracts identity, location, email, active project paths, technical stacks, and user preferences into a persistent long-term memory graph.

### 🛡️ Autonomous Self-Healing & Continuous Self-Improvement
- **Autonomous Error Localization**: Real-time traceback analysis (`actions/auto_heal_engine.py`) that isolates failing lines in first-party code while strictly protecting core immune files.
- **AST Safety Sandbox**: Candidate hotfixes are compiled in memory using Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (`ast.parse()`) and `py_compile` before touching disk.
- **Native Google Gemini Synthesis**: Surgical hotfix generation using Gemini 2.5/2.0-Flash to fix edge cases, `KeyError`, `NoneType`, and boundary errors.
- **Boot Sentry (Anti-Bricking Guarantee)**: Runs at startup before the UI or Gemini loads (`core/boot_sentry.py`). If a recent patch caused a startup crash, it automatically rolls back from `.bak` backup.
- **One-Click & Voice Rollback**: Revert any patch instantly via *"Ultron, undo last patch"* or the UI settings card.
- **Continuous Behavioral Learning**: Permanent rule storage (`config/learned_rules.json`) dynamically injected into `_load_system_prompt()` via `core/learned_rules.py` to personalize Ultron's behavior without modifying source code.
- **Live Test Sandbox**: Includes `actions/test_action.py` and `test_self_heal.py` to test the complete self-repair and rollback lifecycle safely.

## Plugin System

Extend Ultron with custom Python plugins by adding files to `plugins/`.

Supported hooks:

- `on_ultron_created(ultron)` — called when the assistant instance is initialized
- `on_startup(ultron)` — called after startup when plugins are registered
- `on_text_command(text, source, ultron=None)` — called for each incoming text command; return `True` to indicate the command was handled

## Best Practices

- Keep credentials in `config/api_keys.json` and avoid committing secrets.
- Use the virtual environment for all development and runtime sessions.
- Restart the app after changing config or adding plugins.
- Review `config/app_settings.json` to tune voice, UI, and automation behavior.
